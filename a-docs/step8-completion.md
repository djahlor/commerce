# Step 8 Completion: Initial Code Cleanup (Shopify Removal - Phase 1)

## Actions Completed

1. **Removed Shopify Directory**: 
   - Completely removed `lib/shopify/` directory and all its contents

2. **Created Documentation**:
   - Created `a-docs/shopify-replacements.md` to document what functionality needs to be replaced
   - Documented cart operations, product data, collections, etc.

3. **Created Central Types File**:
   - Created `lib/types.ts` with temporary types to replace Shopify types
   - Included `ActionState` type from o1-pro for server actions
   - Defined temporary product, cart, and related types

4. **Updated Key Files**:
   - Modified `components/cart/actions.ts` - Commented out Shopify functionality
   - Modified `components/cart/cart-context.tsx` - Used temporary types
   - Modified `app/layout.tsx` - Added temporary cart provider
   - Modified `app/product/[handle]/page.tsx` - Added mock product data
   - Modified `components/cart/add-to-cart.tsx` - Updated to use central types

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining References**: 
   - Update all remaining files that reference Shopify imports
   - Update component types for proper compatibility

2. **Implement Local State Management**:
   - Step 18: Implement local cart state with Zustand or React Context
   - Step 19: Adapt cart UI components to use local state
   - Step 20: Implement cart actions for local state
   - Step 21: Connect cart to Polar checkout

3. **Product Page Enhancements**:
   - Step 22: Add URL input field to product page

## Note
The current state of the app will have non-functional cart and product functionality until Steps 18-22 are implemented. This is expected as mentioned in the implementation plan's mitigation notes.
